# Doculytics

Doculytics is a web app that allows users to add analytics to their documents regardless
of where they're hosted.

When using Doculytics, you can set up a custom analytics-enabled URL for any URL. When
they click the link, they'll be prompted to enter their email address. Once they do,
they'll be reverse-proxied to the original URL, and tracking will be enabled for their
activity.
